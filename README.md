Preparation and Imaging History:

Cow eye, fixed and stained, was CT scanned at 39 microns (isometric voxels) using a Shimadzu InspeXio micro-CT scanner and resampled to 41 microns for GitHub Distribution.

The sample was sourced from Carolina Biological Supply, where it was fixed and stored in Carolina "Perfect" Solution. It was stained by Paul Gignac with buffered lugol's iodine (2.5% for 14 days).

Micro-CT scanning took place at the University of Arizona Nanofabrication Laboratory by Paul Gignac. Parameters included 150 kV, 120 micro-Amps, 2400 rotation steps, and 3-times image averaging. No filtration was used.

A screenshot from the data capture stage is included with the repository.

The following terms appear in the repistory color table. There anatomical definitions are provided here:

| Structure | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| Sclera | Tough outer layer of the eye that protects the delicate inner parts. |
| Cornea | Clear, dome-shaped structure at the front of the eye that helps to focus incoming light. |
| Iris | Colored part of the eye that controls the size of the pupil and therefore the amount of light that enters the eye. |
| Pupil | Dark, round opening in the center of the iris that changes size in response to light. |
| Lens | Transparent structure located behind the pupil that further focuses the incoming light. |
| Vitreous humor | Clear, jelly-like substance that fills the space between the lens and the retina. |
| Retina | Thin layer of tissue that lines the back of the eye and contains photoreceptor cells that are sensitive to light. |
| Optic nerve | Bundle of nerves that transmits visual information from the retina to the brain. |
| Choroid | Thick, vascular layer of tissue that lies between the sclera and the retina and provides blood supply to the eye. |
| Ciliary body | Structure containing ciliary muscle and processes that controls lens accommodation via zonular fibers and produces aqueous humor. |
